    r"""
    Computes the 2D radial distribution function (pair correlation function) 
    g(r) for a set of points, corrected to take account of the boundary effects.
    
    Parameters:
        
        - array_positions (numpy array, shape Nx2): 
            the (x,y) coordinates of N points.
                
        - bins_distances (numpy array, shape Mx1): 
            a monotonically increasing array of bin edges defining the values 
            of r for which g(r) is going to be computed.
        
    Optional parameters :
        
        - coord_border (numpy array, shape Lx2): 
            the (x,y) coordinates of L points, defining the boundary enclosing 
            the area of interest to compute the g(r).
            Points in array_positions that are outside the area of interest are 
            automatically excluded.
            !! The list of coordinates must be "valid" in the sense used by the
            shapely library: linking all the points in order should result in a
            simple polygon with no line intersecting each other. !!
            
            Ex: Assuming one wants a square border of area 1
                [[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]] is valid (square shape)
                [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]] is not valid (bow tie shape)
                
            If no value is provided, the smallest convex Polygon containing all 
            the points in array_positions is computed using convex_hull. 
            (default value: None)
            
        - coord_holes (list of numpy arrays):
            a list of the (x,y) coordinates of points forming "holes" in the
            area of interest (useful if one is using a geometry with obstacles 
            or exclusion zones where no particles can be found).
            It is possible to define several holes (as long as they do not 
            intersect each other).
            
            Ex: Assuming the area of interest is a square and one wants to 
                to remove a smaller square at the center
                coord_border=[[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
                coord_holes=[[[0.2,0.2],[0.2,0.8],[0.8,0.8],[0.8,0.2]]]
            
            If no value is provided, the area of intereste will be a simple
            polygon with no hole.
            (default value: None)
        
        - fast_method (bool):
            if True, all the points whose distance to the boundary is less than
            the longest distance in bins_distance are excluded from the g(r)
            computation, and only the points sufficiently far away from the 
            boundary are considered. This method is faster, but might exclude a
            lot of points.
            if False, the code computes for each point its distance to the 
            boundary, then computes a normalization factor for the points that 
            are too close to the boundary. This is the default method that 
            correctly takes account of all points, but might be time consuming.
            (default value: False)
            
        - show_timing (bool):
            if True, the code will print outputs showing timings at different
            stages of the computation (to let one know what operations are the
            most time consuming).
            (default value: False)

        - plot (bool): 
            if True, shows the points that were kept, and the computed g(r). 
            (default value: False).
            
        - full_output (bool):
            if True, the function also returns also "raw" distribution of 
            distances between the points PDF(r), the new array of coordinates 
            with only the points that were considered for computing g(r), the 
            distance of each point to the closest boundary of the area of 
            interest, the normalization factors, and the estimated density of 
            points in the area of interest.
            (default value: False). 
    
    Outputs:
    
        - g(r): a 1x(M-1) numpy array (where M is the length of bin_distances)
        - r: a 1x(M-1) numpy array (where M is the length of bin_distances)
    
    Optional output:
        
        - PDF(r): a 1x(M-1) numpy array
        - new_array_positions: a 2xN numpy array
        - distance_to_boundary: a 1xN numpy array
        - normalization_factor: a Nx(M-1) numpy array
        - estimated_density: a float
        
        (where N in the number of points in the area of interest and M is the 
         length of bin_distances)
